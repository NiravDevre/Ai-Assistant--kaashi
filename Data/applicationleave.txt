Here is a sample application for leave:

**Application for Leave**

Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to request a leave of absence from [start date] to [end date]. I need to take [number] days off from work due to [briefly mention the reason for leave, e.g. personal reasons, family emergency, medical reasons, etc.].

I have made sure to check the company's leave policy and I have enough balance of leaves to cover the duration of my absence. I will ensure that all my tasks are completed and my work is up to date before taking my leave. I will also be available by email if anything urgent comes up while I am away.

I would like to request your approval for my leave application. If there are any concerns or issues, please let me know and I will do my best to address them.

Thank you for considering my request.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

Is this what you were looking for? Or would you like me to make any changes?
