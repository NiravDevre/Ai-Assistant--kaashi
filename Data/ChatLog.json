Popular: In this sense, \"pop\" is short for \"popular,\" referring to something that is widely liked, admired, or followed, such as pop music or pop culture.\n2. To remove an item: In computer science and programming, \"pop\" often means to remove the top or last item from a stack or a list, like popping an element from a stack data structure.\n3. A sudden, brief sound: In a more physical sense, \"pop\" can describe a sudden, brief sound, like the noise made when a balloon bursts or a cork is opened.\n\nWithout more context, it's difficult to provide a more specific answer. If you have any additional information or clarification, I'd be happy to try and provide a more precise definition!"
