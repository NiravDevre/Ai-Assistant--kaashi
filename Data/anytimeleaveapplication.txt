Here is a leave application:

Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to request a leave of [number of days] days from [start date] to [end date]. I have a personal commitment that I need to attend to and I will not be able to come to work during this period.

I will make sure to complete all my tasks and ensure that my work is up to date before taking the leave. I will also be available by email if anything urgent comes up while I am away.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could approve my leave request. Please let me know if there are any issues or if there's any additional information you need from me.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,
Nirav Devre
