Here is a song I just came up with:

**Title:** "Lost in the Moment"

**Verse 1:**
I've been searching for a feeling
Something that sets my soul on fire
I've been chasing the highs, ignoring the lows
Trying to find my place in this crazy desire

**Chorus:**
But then I saw you, and everything changed
I got lost in the moment, my heart rearranged
In your eyes, I felt alive
I knew in that instant, I'd be yours tonight

**Verse 2:**
Your smile lit up the room, like a shining star
Your laughter echoed, and I felt like we'd gone too far
Our bodies swayed to the rhythm, our hearts beating as one
I knew in that moment, I'd never be undone

**Chorus:**
'Cause then I saw you, and everything changed
I got lost in the moment, my heart rearranged
In your eyes, I felt alive
I knew in that instant, I'd be yours tonight

**Bridge:**
We danced under the stars, our love shining bright
In that moment, everything felt just right
No worries, no fears, just the thrill of the night
Forever in that instant, our love took flight

**Chorus:**
'Cause then I saw you, and everything changed
I got lost in the moment, my heart rearranged
In your eyes, I felt alive
I knew in that instant, I'd be yours tonight

This is just a sample, and you can always modify it to fit your style and preferences. I hope you like it!
